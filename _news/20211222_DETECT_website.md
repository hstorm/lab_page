<b>Do your Phd in agricultural economics combining deep learning and econometrics!</b>
<br>

Check out the new website for our DFG research center <a href="https://www.lf.uni-bonn.de/en/research/crc-detect">DETECT</a>. We are contributing to project <b>B04</b> in <a href="https://www.lf.uni-bonn.de/en/research/crc-detect/crc-structure/cluster-b/cluster-b-projects">Cluster B</a>  

<br>

In project B04, we are looking for two PhD students in the field of agricultural economics, with some experience in quantitative analysis/data science and an interest in (Bayesian) Econometrics/Machine Learning. One PhD student will focus on the Bayesian approach to merge existing data sources. The second focuses on combining data driven deep learning approaches with econometric approaches considering economic or biophysical information.
