  - 'I am a doctoral student in agricultural economics, conducting research on farm-level consequences of technology adoption. 
  I am interested in exploring methods to provide holistic evaluations of consequences of technology adoption and have an interest 
  in DEA eco-efficiency evaluations. Specifically, in my PhD project, I focus on the secondary and unintended effects of technology adoption
   and the impact on sustainability. Through my research, I want to provide a more nuanced and holistic understanding of what happens on farms 
   when a new technology is adopted.'
